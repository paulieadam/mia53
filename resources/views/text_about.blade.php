Im Mia Adam, a Swedish make up artist, fashion stylist and DJ - with a contagious zest for life. Easygoing but hardworking, problem solver and a doer. 
<br>I grew up moving around with my family and ended up in Stockholm - it became a love story. The variety of creative people inspires me to live out to the fullest. Planet earth can be pretty stressful at times, but my faith keeps me focused. 
<br>It's a great joy to work as a creative entrepreneur. Everyday is different and I love that. I've been working alongside great photographers and production companies in fashion, advertising, magazines and film production for the past eight years.
